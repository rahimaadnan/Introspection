Why did I create Introspection?

-The number of Americans seeing mental health professionals is only increasing. With 53% of Americans admitting the pandemic has harmed their mental health according to the KFF. The CDC reported ⅓  households have a member aged 18 to 34 who has seen a mental health professional over the last 12 months. 

-The first thing your therapist asks you in a session is how was your past week. That is a hard question to answer on the spot. With the app, your provider can see how your week went. This can make sessions more productive. As your provider already knows what symptoms you were feeling throughout the week. Also, if your client has a hard time expressing what is going on you can read their check-in’s and get a better understanding. Your therapist can see behaviors, symptoms, and emotions not present at your session.
